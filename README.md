# Team-Alpaca auth_wiki

# Dear Zuri
# As at the time this Repo was created, used and submitted.
# The Team Lead of Team Alpaca wasn't invited to create a Repo hosted on Zuri Training GitHub account.

# That's why this Repo was submitted for Milestones 1 and 2. 

# From Milestones 3, the correct Repo was submitted because as at then, Team Alpaca's Team Lead received an invitation to create the Repo
From Zuri training GitHub account.


# Kindly use https://github.com/zuri-training/team-Alpaca as the correct Repo for grading.

# Thank you 

# The correct Repo is https://github.com/zuri-training/team-Alpaca
